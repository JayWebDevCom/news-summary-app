Hi Kay, I hope you don't mind, but I have another code review if possible.
This time it is for news app and API testing. I think I really need to get these
principles squared away which is why I am asking for you to steer and guide my
efforts. Thanks very much indeed.
Please see https://github.com/JayWebDevCom/news-summary-app
Code review - https://github.com/JayWebDevCom/news-summary-app/blob/master/code_review.txt

Please use
node node_modules/http-server/bin/http-server
to run this app on 8080.
News Page - http://localhost:8080/index.html
Tests Page - http://localhost:8080/tests.html

I initialized and installed npm which gave me the associated node modules but
they may not be needed at this stage - except for http-server.

I would have liked to have covered this project using express and npm start
methods but I have not had time yet to learn express and its intricacies but
I will find time to do so.

I should have made more commits but I have a habit of only committing when there
is obvious progress which in this challenge took a while. I should commit as I develop
not only when things work as intended.

I need to learn more about the XMLHttpRequest process and find out exactly what
goes on behind the scenes.

I think that I have made a positive effort to mock and test the API sending
using DI and fake constructors. I got a bit confused with creating a text node
and appendChild which I mocked to an innerHTML addition so the code became a
little but convoluted in extracting the specific parts to be tested.

I also tested the api response and responseText processing as well as I could.
I see now that these tests should have been broken up into perhaps three more
manageable tests as follows;

A test of XMLHttpRequest instantiation
A test of XMLHttpRequest sending and responding
A test of XMLHttpRequest responseText processing

I could have used a more MVC approach to process the incoming responseText and
format it to appear as a link. The controller could run the XMLHttpRequest,
passing the response text to a view model which updates the page.

I perhaps should use mocha? Im not sure which tools to use and when. I feel a
little overwhelmed my the number of available tools and I do not know which ones
work together and when.

I would still like to mock and test the button pressing and I intend to learn how
to do so soon and implement it but I am just under such time pressure to move on
to subsequent projects.

I would like to improve on the aesthetics and appearance of my app but I felt
it best to concentrate on functionality at this point.

I have not covered all the user stories - again due to time pressure.

My API key should be protected with environment variables and not exposed.

I have wrapped my tests code wrapped in modular syntax and exported as necessary,
but I still feel that they are accessible from anywhere as a result of the IIFE
which leads me to believe that they are not 'private' or 'protected' as they
should be perhaps?

I would have liked to test instantiation of XMLHttpRequest objects but I ran
out of time.
